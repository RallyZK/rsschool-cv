**Briefly About Myself:**

Having started my career as an engineer in a small company with no skills, I became one of tree the best engineers in this company. Three years ago I’ve become a head of depatment.

Now working as an engineer gives me extra free time, which I spend learning Frontend Development. I’m interested in Web Development because this occupation provides huge possibilities for professional growth and a large community of developers. 

I am an good team worker and very willing to learn and develop new skills. I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.

if (g <= 0) {g = '00'} else if (g > 0 && g < 10) {g = '0' + g} else if (g > 255) {g = 255}
if (b <= 0) {b = '00'} else if (b > 0 && b < 10) {b = '0' + b} else if (b > 255) {b = 255}
let R, G, B;
if (r.toString(16).length < 2) {R = '0' + r.toString(16)} else {R = r.toString(16)}
if (g.toString(16).length < 2) {G = '0' + g.toString(16)} else {G = g.toString(16)}

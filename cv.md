**Briefly About Myself:**

Having started my career as an engineer in a small company with no skills, I became one of tree the best engineers in this company. Three years ago I’ve become a head of depatment.

Now working as an engineer gives me extra free time, which I spend learning Frontend Development. I’m interested in Web Development because this occupation provides huge possibilities for professional growth and a large community of developers. 

I am an good team worker and very willing to learn and develop new skills. I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.
